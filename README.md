# FEND P2 - Portfolio

Porfolio Project for the Udacity Front End Web Developer nanodegree program

## Notes

1. The responsive framework I used was the Skeleton Framework: [http://getskeleton.com](http://getskeleton.com)
--* It is a lightweight, simple grid-based framework.
--* It is easy to understand how it works and how to use without extensive documentation.
--* It is very easy to customize.
--* This framework is more than adequate to layout this project.

2. The Skeleton framework uses rem units rather than em units. I had no previous knowledge of rem units and found this article helpful: [http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/comprehensive-guide-when-to-use-em-vs-rem--cms-23984](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/comprehensive-guide-when-to-use-em-vs-rem--cms-23984)
